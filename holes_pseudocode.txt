    def detect_holes(self):
        Perform image processing to detect the holes in the tray
        - Apply Gaussian blur to the image
        - Convert the image to HSV color space
        - Create a mask for the desired color range (blue)
        - Find contours in the mask and filter based on size
        - Find the center of each hole and check if it lies within the tray contour
        - Draw rectangles around the holes and store their centers
        - Call find_missing_points() to identify missing points in the grid

    def find_missing_points(self):
        Identify missing points in the grid formed by the holes
        - Sort the hole centers based on their x-coordinate
        - Create a matrix of rows, where each row contains consecutive holes
        - Calculate the mean distance between consecutive holes in each row
        - Identify missing points by comparing the distances between holes and the mean distance
        - Store the missing points for further processing
