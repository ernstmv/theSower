class Autoset:
    Initialize instance variables:
        kernel = 11
        c = 2
        change = False
        img = None
        mask = None
        tray = None
        centers = None

    Method set_image(img):
        Set self.img to the input image
        Set self.mask to a zero matrix with the same shape as self.img

    Method get_image():
        Apply a weighted blend of self.img and self.mask
        Return the blended image

    Method autoset_tray():
        Convert self.img to grayscale
        Apply Gaussian blur to the grayscale image
        Apply adaptive thresholding to the blurred image
        Find contours in the thresholded image
        Select the largest contour as self.tray
        Draw self.tray on self.mask
        Draw a larger contour on a separate mask
        Apply Canny edge detection to the larger contour mask
        Apply HoughLinesP to find lines in the edge image
        If no lines are found, return None
        Calculate the centers of the lines using KMeans clustering
        For each center, calculate the slopes of the lines passing through it
        If less than 2 slopes are found, return None
        Determine the color of each center based on the slopes
        If all centers are correctly identified, return True
        Otherwise, return False

    Method detect_tray():
        If autoset_tray() returns True, return True
        If self.change is False, increment self.kernel by 2 and keep self.c at 2
        If self.change is True, increment self.c by 0.1 and reset self.kernel to 3
        If self.c reaches 5, reset self.c to 2 and toggle self.change
